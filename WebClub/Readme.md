# CodeBuddy Problems
**Week 2**

-> You are climbing a stair case and it takes A steps to reach to the top.
Each time you can either climb 1 or 2 steps. In how many distinct ways can you climb to the top?

Eg: A=4 O/p=5([1,1,1,1];[1,2,1];[2,1,1];[1,1,2];[2,2])

**Week 6**
-> The string "PAYPALISHIRING" is written in a zigzag pattern and then read line by line:
Eg: string convert(string text, int nRows);
convert("PAYPALISHIRING", 3) should return "PAHNAPLSIIGYIR"
